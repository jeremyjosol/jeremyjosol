- 🌱 Hi, I’m Jeremy Josol. I have a strong background in agrocultural cultivation and irrigation technology control systems.
- 👀 I'm interested in creating better design solutions to enhance user interface experiences and writing clean modular code.
- 💦 I’m currently learning about irrigation software and functional programming languages such as C# and frameworks like React.
- 🌐 I’m open to collaborate on creative projects - whether with cultivators, creative artists, directors, music talent, or personal.
