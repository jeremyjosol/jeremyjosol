- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeremy Josol. I have a strong background in agrocultural cultivation and irrigation technology controllers.
- 👀 Because of my background, I've become interested in creating better design solutions to enhance user experiences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about irrigation technology software and functional programming languages such as C# and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects- whether with cultivators, creative artists, directors, music talent, or personal.
